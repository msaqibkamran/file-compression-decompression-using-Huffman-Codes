# file-compression-decompression-using-Huffman-Codes
A file compression algorithm that uses binary trees and min binary heaps (priority queues). This program allows the user to compress and decompress files using the standard Huffman algorithm for encoding and decoding. Moreover, own hash table is implemented which which is being used in the Huffman encoding.

# Working
A rogram that takes a text file from the user, compute the character codes using Huffman codes
as described above and save the encoded/compressed file to the disk. It also decode
the compressed file using the binary tree built for encoding.

# How to Run
This project is built in Visual Studio in C++ language which is required in order to execute this project.
